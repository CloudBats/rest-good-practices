# Introduction

This project is a simplified list of rules for good REST API design.

There are many exhaustive resources online about HTTP and REST APIs, this project doesn't intend to become that. 

This site's content isn't inspired from its author's opinions, but from both open and closed source publications, such as:

- websites:
    - [freeCodeCamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-api-best-practices-rest-endpoint-design-examples), single page, covers the basics well
    - [Microsoft Azure Architecture article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design), single page, high quality content, experienced audience
    - [Mozilla HTTP Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP#reference), well-structured, very comprehensive, mostly for reference, not for reading end-to-end
- books:
    - [REST API Design Rulebook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/rest-api-design/9781449317904), highly recommended, concise, good for any experience level
    - [Hands-On RESTful API Design Patterns and Best Practices](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-restful-api/9781788992664/), comprehensive, academic approach, covers advanced concepts in later chapters

This project has no affiliation with the authors mentioned above.
